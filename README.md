# University Carpooling/Ride Sharing App

This repository hosts the initial assets and documentation for the University Carpooling & Ride Sharing app, aimed at providing a secure and user-friendly platform for students to share rides within the university community.

## Project Overview

The app enables students to register with verified university emails, select roles as drivers or passengers, post rides, book available rides, and communicate through in-app messaging. Safety features such as female-only ride filters and verified driver profiles increase trust and security. The repository currently contains user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, wireframes, and planning artifacts consistent with Agile methodology and Kanban board tracking.

## Current Repository Content

- **API Design**: Conceptual design of endpoints for authentication, ride posting, booking, notifications.  
- **Documentation**: User stories, acceptance criteria, requirements documents, sprint meeting notes.  
- **Frontend**: Initial wireframe designs and UI flow sketches for registration, ride management, and chat.  
- **Backend**: Planned directory structure and architectural notes, no code yet.  
- **Project Management**: Agile Kanban board setup, meeting minutes, sprint planning and retrospective documents.
